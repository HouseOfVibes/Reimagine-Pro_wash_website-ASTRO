As a homeowner in Knightdale, NC, you know that our humid climate can take
a toll on your home's exterior. But how do you know when it's time to call
in the professionals? Here are 5 clear signs that your property needs pressure washing.

## 1. Dark Streaks on Your Siding

Those black or green streaks running down your vinyl or wood siding? That's

humid environment.
